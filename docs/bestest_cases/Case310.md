# Case 310: East/West Shading (Overhang + Fins)

## Base Case

Based on Case 300, with shading devices added to east and west windows.

## Changes from Case 300

- Shading devices (horizontal overhang and vertical fins) are added to both east and west windows, as specified in Sections 5.2.2.1.3.1 and 5.2.2.1.3.2 (Case 630).
- Overhang and fin geometry: same as Case 630.
- Shading device construction: same as Case 610/630.
- All other parameters remain as in Case 300.

## Required Outputs

- Non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- Comparing Cases 310 and 300 isolates the effect of east/west window shading (overhang + fins).
- This uses the same shading geometry as Case 630 but in the simplified diagnostic context.
