# Case 290: South Shading (Overhang)

## Base Case

Based on Case 270, with a south window overhang added.

## Changes from Case 270

- A horizontal overhang is added as specified in Sections 5.2.2.1.1.1 and 5.2.2.1.1.2 (Case 610).
- The horizontal overhang for south-facing windows extends across the entire length of the south wall.
- Overhang depth: 1.0 m, height above window top: 0.5 m.
- Overhang construction properties: same as Case 610 (solar absorptance = 1, IR emittance = 0, smallest thickness).
- All other parameters remain as in Case 270.

## Required Outputs

- Non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- Comparing Cases 290 and 270 isolates the effect of south window shading (overhang).
- This uses the same overhang geometry as Case 610 but in the simplified diagnostic context (no infiltration, no internal gains, high interior absorptance).
