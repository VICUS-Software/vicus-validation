# Case 680FF: Free-Float Increased Exterior Wall and Roof Insulation

## Base Case

Based on Case 680 (increased insulation), with no mechanical heating or cooling.

## Changes from Case 680

- No mechanical heating or cooling of the building.
- All other parameters remain as in Case 680 (increased wall and roof insulation).

## Required Outputs

- All free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.6
- Daily hourly output specified for Case 680FF in Section 6.2.1.8
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- This combines the increased insulation of Case 680 with free-floating temperatures.
- The better-insulated envelope will result in higher summer peak temperatures and less extreme winter lows compared to Case 600FF.
