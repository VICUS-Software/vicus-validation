# Case 420: Internal Gains (Deadband Thermostat)

## Base Case

Based on Case 410, with internal gains added.

## Changes from Case 410

- Internal gains = 200 W, continuously (24 hours per day, full year)
- Internal gains are 100% sensible, 0% latent
- Sensible internal gains are 60% radiative, 40% convective
- All other parameters remain as in Case 410 (0.5 ach infiltration, 20,27 thermostat).

## Required Outputs

- Non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- Comparing Cases 420 and 410 isolates the effect of internal heat generation (200 W vs. 0 W) with the deadband thermostat and infiltration present.
