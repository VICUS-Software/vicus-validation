# Case 950FF: Free-Float High-Mass Night Ventilation

## Base Case

Based on Case 950 (high-mass night ventilation), with no mechanical heating or cooling.

## Changes from Case 950

- No mechanical heating or cooling of the building.
- The mechanical ventilation schedule from Case 650 remains:
  - From 1800 to 0700 hours: vent fan = ON
  - From 0700 to 1800 hours: vent fan = OFF
- Ventilation fan characteristics: same as Case 650/950 (1700 m^3/h, waste heat = 0).
- Standard infiltration (0.5 ach) remains.

## Required Outputs

- All free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.6
- Daily hourly output specified for Case 950FF in Section 6.2.1.8
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- This combines high thermal mass, night ventilation, and free-floating temperatures.
- The high mass combined with night ventilation should produce significantly lower peak temperatures than Case 900FF.
