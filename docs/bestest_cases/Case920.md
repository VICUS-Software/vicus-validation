# Case 920: High-Mass East/West Window Orientation

## Base Case

Based on Case 620 (east/west windows), with high-mass construction from Case 900.

## Changes from Case 620

- Exterior wall and floor material properties are replaced with those from Case 900 (Table 5-27):
  - Walls: concrete block + foam insulation + wood siding
  - Floor: concrete slab + insulation
- Roof remains as in Case 600/620.
- Window orientation remains as in Case 620 (6 m^2 east, 6 m^2 west, no south or north windows).

## Required Outputs

- All non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- This is the high-mass equivalent of Case 620 -- east/west windows with massive wall and floor construction.
- The combination of east/west solar exposure and high thermal mass will differ from both Case 620 and Case 900.
