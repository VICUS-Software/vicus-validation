# Case 410: Infiltration (Deadband Thermostat)

## Base Case

Based on Case 400, with infiltration added.

## Changes from Case 400

- Infiltration rate = 0.5 ach, continuously (24 hours per day, full year).
- Altitude adjustment applies as in Section 5.2.1.6.1 (Case 600).
- All other parameters remain as in Case 400.

## Required Outputs

- Non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- Comparing Cases 410 and 400 isolates the effect of infiltration (0.5 ach vs. 0 ach) with the deadband thermostat.
- This is the "20,27" equivalent of Case 230, but with 0.5 ach instead of 1.0 ach.
