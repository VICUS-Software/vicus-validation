# Case 240: Internal Gains

## Base Case

Based on Case 220, with internal gains added.

## Changes from Case 220

- Internal gains = 200 W, continuously (24 hours per day, full year)
- Internal gains are 100% sensible, 0% latent
- Sensible internal gains are 60% radiative, 40% convective
- All other parameters remain as in Case 220.

## Required Outputs

- Non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- Comparing Cases 240 and 220 isolates the effect of internal heat generation (200 W vs. 0 W).
- The radiative/convective split (60/40) of internal gains should be modeled correctly.
