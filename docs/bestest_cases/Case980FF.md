# Case 980FF: Free-Float High-Mass Increased Exterior Wall and Roof Insulation

## Base Case

Based on Case 980 (high-mass increased insulation), with no mechanical heating or cooling.

## Changes from Case 980

- No mechanical heating or cooling of the building.
- All other parameters remain as in Case 980 (high-mass, increased wall and roof insulation).

## Required Outputs

- All free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.6
- Daily hourly output specified for Case 980FF in Section 6.2.1.8
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- This combines high thermal mass, increased insulation, and free-floating temperatures.
- The combination of high mass and high insulation will produce the smallest temperature swings and highest summer peak temperatures among the free-float cases.
