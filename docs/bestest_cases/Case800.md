# Case 800: High Mass without Solar Gains

## Base Case

Based on Case 430, with high-mass wall and floor construction from Case 900.

## Changes from Case 430

- Exterior wall and floor material properties are replaced with those from Case 900 (Table 5-27, Section 5.2.2.2.1.1).
- Roof materials remain as in Case 600 (Table 5-2, Section 5.2.1.4).
- High-conductance wall elements remain as in Case 430 (same as Case 220).
- All other parameters remain as in Case 430:
  - Internal gains: 200 W, continuous
  - Infiltration: 0.5 ach
  - Exterior solar absorptance: 0.6
  - Thermostat: 20,27 deadband
  - No windows (high-conductance wall elements on south wall)

## Required Outputs

- Non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- Case 800 tests high thermal mass without solar gains (no transparent windows).
- Comparing Cases 800 and 430 isolates the effect of thermal mass on loads when there are no solar gains through glazing.
- The high-mass construction (concrete block walls, concrete slab floor) combined with high-conductance wall elements provides a diagnostic tool for mass effects.
