# Case 910: High-Mass South Shading

## Base Case

Based on Case 610 (south shading overhang), with high-mass construction from Case 900.

## Changes from Case 610

- Exterior wall and floor material properties are replaced with those from Case 900 (Table 5-27):
  - Walls: concrete block + foam insulation + wood siding
  - Floor: concrete slab + insulation
- Roof remains as in Case 600/610.
- Overhang geometry and properties remain exactly as in Case 610.

## Required Outputs

- All non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- This is the high-mass equivalent of Case 610 -- same south overhang but with massive wall and floor construction.
- The thermal mass affects how the building responds to the reduced solar gains from the overhang.
