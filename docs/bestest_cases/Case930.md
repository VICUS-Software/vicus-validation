# Case 930: High-Mass East/West Shading

## Base Case

Based on Case 630 (east/west windows with overhang + fins), with high-mass construction from Case 900.

## Changes from Case 630

- Exterior wall and floor material properties are replaced with those from Case 900 (Table 5-27):
  - Walls: concrete block + foam insulation + wood siding
  - Floor: concrete slab + insulation
- Roof remains as in Case 600/630.
- Window orientation and shading geometry remain exactly as in Case 630 (east/west windows with overhang and vertical fins).

## Required Outputs

- All non-free-float case output per Section 6.2.1.1
- General reporting requirements of Section 6.1

## NANDRAD Modeling Notes

- This is the high-mass equivalent of Case 630 -- east/west windows with shading devices and massive wall and floor construction.
